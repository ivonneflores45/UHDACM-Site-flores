# Chatbot Backend  

This is the backend for the chatbot application. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2. Navigate to the project directory.  
3. Install the required dependencies:  

  ```bash  
  npm install  
  ```  

## Environment Variables
```
Set the following environment variables in a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEYS=<key>,<key2>,...
CHROMA_DB_HOST=localhost
CHROMA_DB_PORT=5477
CHROMA_DB_COLLECTION_NAME=primary
PORT=4000

# if logging enabled, will use betterstack logger.
ENABLE_LOGGER=false
COLLECTOR_SOURCE_SECRET=<secret>
COLLECTOR_INGESTING_HOST=<https-host>
```

- `GOOGLE_API_KEYS`: Comma-separated list of Google API keys.
- `CHROMA_DB_HOST`: Hostname for the Chroma database.
- `CHROMA_DB_PORT`: Port number for the Chroma database.
- `CHROMA_DB_COLLECTION_NAME`: Name of the Chroma collection to use.
- `PORT`: Port for the backend server.
```

## Running the Chroma Server  

Start the Chroma server by running the following command:  

```bash  
npm run chroma-server  
```  

> NOTE: for local testing, only one instance of the chroma-server is necessary
> 
> If `vector-context-manager`'s chromaDB server is running already, you don't need to run this one.
>
> Ensure the port for chromaDB is the same as `vector-context-manager`'s port.
> 
> Unexpected behavior will occur otherwise.
> 
> If you're connecting to a cloud instance, ensure the env is set properly.

## Running the Ingester  

To add context to the chatbot, run the ingester with the `input.txt` file:  

```bash  
npm run ingestTest  
```  

## Running the Server  

Finally, start the backend server:  

```bash  
npm run dev  
```

Your chatbot backend should now be up and running!
